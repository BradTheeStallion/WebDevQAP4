//QAP4: Motel Customer Information
//By Brad Ayers
//March 20-24, 2024

//This program will prompt the user for information about a customer staying at a motel. The user will be asked for the customer's name, date of birth, room preference, payment card information, mailing address, contact information, and stay information. The program will then display the customer information.

//I have included some default values for the prompts to make testing easier. These can be removed or changed as needed. The prompts are commented out and can be uncommented to run the program in the browser console. Please be gentle with the input validation and use believable values :)

//To use test values: uncomment lines 13-48 and comment lines 50-270. Comment lines 13-48 and uncomment lines 50-270 to use prompts.

//I chose not to ask the customer about their gender.
